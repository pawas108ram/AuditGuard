# SolidInspect AI

SolidInspect AI is a powerful tool designed to audit smart contracts with high accuracy. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by OpenAI and LangChain, this project ensures thorough smart contract analysis, generating test codes, and even facilitating code refactoring.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Auditing:** SolidInspect AI employs advanced LLMs to thoroughly audit smart contracts, identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the highest standards of security.

- **Test Code Generation:** The tool automatically generates test codes for the audited smart contract, streamlining the testing process and enhancing code reliability.

- **Code Refactoring:** SolidInspect AI goes beyond auditing and offers code refactoring suggestions, improving the overall quality and maintainability of the smart contract code.

## Technologies Used

- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building modern and responsive user interfaces.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

- **ReactJS:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making it easy to develop interactive and dynamic front-end applications.

- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python, providing a simple and flexible foundation for building web applications.

- **OpenAI:** Harnessing the power of OpenAI's language models to perform smart contract analysis and generate intelligent suggestions.

- **LangChain:** An innovative language technology platform, contributing to the capabilities of SolidInspect AI in understanding and enhancing smart contract code.
